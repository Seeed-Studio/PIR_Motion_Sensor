PIR_Motion_Sensor
-------------------------------------------------------------
There actually are different kinds of motion sensors from Seeed-Studio:
- Grove - PIR Motion Sensor [1]
- PIR Motion sensor module [2]
- Tiny PIR Motion sensor module [3]
Take note that the content was written for the Grove version. For example that operates at 5 V only, while the PIR Motion sensor [2] also operates at 3,3 V and can be used directly connected to the Raspberry Pi.

This is a simple to use PIR motion sensor with Grove compatible interface. This sensor allows you to sense motion, usually human movement in its range. Simply connect it to Grove - Base shield and program it, when anyone moves in its detecting range, the sensor will output HIGH on its SIG pin. The detecting range and response speed can be adjusted by 2 potentiometers soldered on its circuit board. The response speed is from 0.3s - 25s, and max 6 meters of detecting range.
